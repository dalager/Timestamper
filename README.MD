Timestamper
----------------------------

Simple tool that reverse timestamps your files according to alphabetical sort order

Why?

Well, if you're using a podcast app for audiobooks and that podcast app ONLY understands sorting by dates. You will need something like this.

(I'm looking at you Windows Phone 8.1...)
