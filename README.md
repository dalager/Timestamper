Timestamper
----------------------------

Simple tool that reverse timestamps your files according to alphabetical sort order

Why?

Well, if you're using a podcast app for audiobooks and that podcast app ONLY understands sorting by dates. You will need something like this.

(I'm looking at you Windows Phone 8.1...)


Usage:


TimeStamper.exe "C:\myaudiobooks\catcher_in_the_rye\"

Result:

All files in folder will be timestamped so the first file will be the newest.

1. 01_part_one.mp3 2009-12-30
2. 02_part_one.mp3 2009-12-29
3. 03_part_one.mp3 2009-12-28
